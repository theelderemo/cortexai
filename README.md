# DEV UPDATE:
I have a new version of the agent loop I'll be committing soon. It uses loop logic, has bigger base tool calling, and stricter rules based on project scope. 

> [!TIP]
> There is now an official [CortexAI Plugin Repo](https://github.com/theelderemo/cortexai-plugins) for a community first platform. Go check it out!

## What is CortexAI?

CortexAI is **not another pentesting tool suite** 
It's an autonomous AI agent that conducts authorized security assessments the way a senior security consultant would: by reasoning about objectives, orchestrating the right tools, explaining its decisions, and continuously improving its approach.

Traditional tools like Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP require you to manually decide which scans to run, interpret results, and document findings. **CortexAI is different**:

```bash
You: "Run an initial security assessment on this web app"
```

CortexAI: 
 - ✓ Reasoning: Breaking down into content discovery, technology fingerprinting, and structure analysis
 -  ✓ Executing: discover_content, web_request, browse_website (3 tools orchestrated)
 -  ✓ Analyzing: Found CORS misconfiguration, missing security headers, exposed login form
 -  ✓ Logging: 3 medium-severity vulnerabilities stored to project database
 -  ✓ Recommending: Next steps include JavaScript analysis and XSS testing

**This is agentic AI**—autonomous planning, multi-tool orchestration, contextual reasoning, and transparent decision-making in a single platform.

## Why CortexAI?

### **Autonomous Agent, Not a Workflow**
- **Self-planning**: Give high-level objectives ("assess this target"), not step-by-step instructions
- **Dynamic tool selection**: Agent chooses the right tools based on mission context
- **Contextual memory**: Understands follow-up commands like "log that" by referencing its own previous output
- **Adaptive execution**: When tools fail, automatically switches strategies and continues the mission

### **Self-Explaining and Transparent**
- **Real-time audit logs**: Separate terminal window shows every action, tool call, and decision
- **Explains failures**: "Puppeteer failed due to ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT—here's why and here are 7 alternatives"
- **Justifies decisions**: Every action includes reasoning (why this tool, why this approach, why this severity rating)
- **Compliance-ready**: GDPR/NIST-compatible explainable AI for regulated industries

### **Self-Improving Infrastructure**
- **Recommends missing tools**: "I need Playwright for dynamic rendering—here's how to install it"
- **Dynamic capability expansion**: New tools automatically registered when installed
- **Ecosystem intelligence**: Knows 100+ security tools, their use cases, and when to apply them
- **Continuous learning**: Adapts strategies based on environmental feedback

### **Enterprise-Grade Project Management**
- **SQLite project databases**: Every engagement tracked with scope, findings, evidence, and audit trails
- **Immutable evidence collection**: Chain-of-custody for HTTP requests, responses, and discovered assets
- **OWASP/CWE classification**: Automatic mapping of findings to industry standards
- **Multi-engagement tracking**: Manage dozens of concurrent assessments with isolated contexts

### **Extensible Plugin Architecture**
- **26+ built-in tools** across 5 core plugins (web analysis, filesystem, command execution, encoding)
- **Community marketplace ready**: Third-party plugins load dynamically without touching core code
- **Tool abstraction layer**: Works with any CLI security tool already installed on your system
- **Open architecture**: Build custom plugins following our manifest standard

***

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Azure OpenAI API access (or configure alternative providers in roadmap)
- Authorized testing environment with written permission

### Installation

**Option 1: Local (Recommended)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theelderemo/cortexai.git
cd cortexai
npm install
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Add your Azure OpenAI credentials
npm start
```

Option 2: Docker
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theelderemo/cortexai.git
cd cortexai
docker build -t cortexai:latest .
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/.env:/opt/cortexai/.env cortexai:latest
Configuration
```


**Option 3: CortexOS (custom Kali deviated OS)**
```bash
# Coming soon
```

### Configuration

## Configuring Limited Sudo Access (Optional)

CortexAI operates with the privileges of the user running it. For certain tasks, like installing necessary tools or performing specific types of network scans, it might require elevated (`sudo`) privileges. To avoid needing to enter your password repeatedly and to limit the agent's root access, you can configure passwordless `sudo` for *specific* commands only.

> [!WARNING]
>  **Critical Warning:** Modifying sudo permissions is a sensitive operation. Incorrect configuration can compromise your system's security or lock you out. **Never** edit /etc/sudoers directly. Always use the visudo command, which performs syntax checks before saving:

```bash
sudo visudo
```
Granting Specific Passwordless Permissions
Identify Required Commands: Determine the exact commands CortexAI might need sudo for (e.g., systemctl start <service>, specific nmap options). Be as specific as possible.

Edit Sudoers: Add a line in visudo for the user running CortexAI (replace cortexuser with the actual username YOU CREATE).

Allow cortexuser to run specific commands without a password for CortexAI
```
cortexuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/specific/command1, /usr/bin/another/command --with-options *
cortexuser: The username running CortexAI.
```

ALL=(ALL): Allows running on this host, usually as root.

NOPASSWD:: Enables passwordless execution for the listed commands.

/usr/bin/specific/command1: Use the full path to the command. You can find this using which <command>.

Separate multiple commands with commas. You can use wildcards (*) but do so with extreme caution.

Restricting Dangerous Commands
You can also explicitly deny the user from running certain dangerous commands with sudo, even if broader permissions might otherwise allow them. Add these after the NOPASSWD line:

Deny dangerous commands for cortexuser even with sudo
```
cortexuser ALL=(ALL) !/usr/bin/rm *, !/usr/sbin/shutdown, !/usr/sbin/reboot, !/usr/bin/passwd, !/usr/bin/cat /path/to/your/secure/files/*
```
The ! negates the permission for the specified command.

Important Note on Tool Installation
System package managers (apt, yum, dnf, etc.) require root privileges. Granting passwordless sudo access to commands like apt install * is discouraged as it effectively grants full root access.

Safer alternatives for tool installation:

Pre-install Tools: Manually install all required security tools using your own sudo access before running CortexAI.

User-Level Installs: Instruct CortexAI to install tools in the user's home directory if the tool supports it (e.g., pip install --user, Go tools).

Use Docker: Run CortexAI within the provided CortexOS Docker container. Inside the container, the agent can safely install tools using the container's package manager without affecting your host system or requiring your host sudo password. This is the most secure and flexible approach.

Create a `.env` file with your AI provider credentials:

```env
AZURE_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint-here
AZURE_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o
AZURE_DEPLOYMENT=your-deployment-name
AZURE_API_KEY=your-api-key
AZURE_API_VERSION=2024-12-01-preview

# Optional: Disable terminal formatting
AGENT_DISABLE_FORMATTING=false
```

***

## Example Usage

### Creating and Managing Projects
```bash
> "Create a new project for testing example.com with API and web scope"

CortexAI creates project, initializes database, sets scope rules automatically

> "Add https://example.com/* to scope but exclude /admin/*"

Scope manager updated, out-of-scope routes will be automatically skipped

> "Launch the database viewer"

Opens SQLite browser GUI for real-time project monitoring
```

### Autonomous Security Assessment
```bash
> "Perform comprehensive security testing on this target"

CortexAI autonomously:
  1. Discovers hidden content (admin panels, config files, backups)
  2. Fingerprints technologies (server versions, frameworks, libraries)
  3. Analyzes client-side behavior (JavaScript endpoints, form inputs)
  4. Tests for OWASP Top 10 (XSS, SQLi, CSRF, authentication flaws)
  5. Logs findings with severity ratings and remediation guidance
  6. Generates structured report with attack surface analysis
```

### Contextual Intelligence
```bash
> "Can you run an initial scan but don't use nmap"

Agent autonomously selects alternative reconnaissance tools

> "Log that"

Agent understands "that" refers to findings in previous output,
extracts all distinct vulnerabilities, and logs each with correct severity

> "Why did Puppeteer fail?"

Agent explains: ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT, fallback strategy used,
recommends 7 alternative tools (Playwright, Selenium, etc.) with installation commands
```

### Plugin System
Every plugin includes a `plugin.json` manifest:
```json
{
  "name": "custom-scanner",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "description": "Custom vulnerability scanner",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "scan_custom_vuln",
      "description": "Detects custom vulnerability patterns",
      "parameters": { "url": "string", "depth": "integer" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Plugins auto-load at startup. The AI agent automatically discovers and uses new tools without configuration[1].
